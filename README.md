# Data Visualization Project
The objective is to show how you managed to use visualization concepts and techniques to 
transform data into a meaningful interactive visualization. Maximum of 4 students per group. 
The project should be implemented using Plotly with Dash software or Tableau. It is not 
enough just to develop a sophisticated application; you need to frame it using Data 
Visualization techniques and concepts explored during the course. Try to something that 
matches your professional/academic interests.
